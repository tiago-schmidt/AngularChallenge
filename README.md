# Angular Challenge

## Production server

Please visit [My Calendar Application](https://angular-challenge-rjpnikifc-tiago-schmidt.vercel.app) to check it on the production server.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## API Keys

I have created the following OpenWeather Api Key to use in the application: `c46d2c52586a81c43ec28fda763964c9`
It is also stored in the 'src/app/utils/consts.ts' file. 

## Quick notes

The feature `Properly handle overflow when multiple reminders appear on the same date.` is unfinished.
Even though it has some bugs in this feature I figured out it would be better to leave them in the code to keep the reference to my work and add some TODO comments to it, in a day-to-day work basis I would not push it to the repository and would inform the PO that it needed some fixes first.
